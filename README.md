The project's goal was to develop an application that can control a robot with simple building blocks. Yes, absolutely like [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu)!

The robot we worked with used [ROS](https://www.ros.org) (**R**obot **O**perating **S**ystem), therefor we developed scripts that open up an interface for the app to interface with. Those can be found under `./src/ros`
